## Project Objective
HuskyFilmFestival is a full-stack web application that allows filmmakers to submit their films for screening consideration and enables users to purchase tickets for the festival. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the platform provides a seamless experience for both creators and attendees.

An admin dashboard allows authorized users to log in, review submissions, and manage customer purchases, including editing or deleting records as needed. The project showcases a complete integration of front-end and back-end technologies to create a dynamic, responsive, and secure event management platform.

## Tools used
- React (frontend) 
- Node.js (backend)
- Express (server)
- MongoDB (database)
- nodemon (dev)
- ESLint, Prettier (code quality/formatting)
- React-Bootstrap (styling)

## Project Structure
- backend.js                 - main Express server (entry)
- package.json               - project metadata & scripts
- node_modules/              - installed packages
- public/ or client/         - frontend assets (Created by React)
- screenshots/               
- README.md                  


## Instructions to build (Locally)=
Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm
- MongoDB running locally or a cloud URI

1. Clone the repo and open the project folder:
   - git clone <repo-url>
   - cd HuskyFilmFestival

2. Install dependencies:
   - npm install

3. Configure environment:
   - Create a MongoDB DB and 2 collections (Tickets and filmSubmissions). 
   - Create a .env file and Set MONGO_URI to the appropriate connection (e.g. export MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/huskyfilm")
   - Upload sample data (data for ![filmSubmissions](data/Sample Film Data.json) linked)

4. Start the backend server (uses nodemon):
   - npm install
   - npm start
   - By default this runs nodemon and watches backend.js; visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port your backend uses).

5. Frontend :
   - cd frontend
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
   - For production build: npm run build (then serve the build folder with a static server)




Notes:
- If your server uses a different port or script, update the commands accordingly.
- Ensure MongoDB is reachable using the MONGO_URI you configured.

## AI Usage
This README was created/edited with assistance from GitHub Copilot (GPT-5 mini). 

GitHub Copilot was used to help troubleshoot page loading issues (incorrect path configuration) and issues with rendering films - but did not allow it to auto generate/change files (GPT-5 mini).

Anthropic's Claude was used to help troubleshoot reloading issues on the Film Review (admin) and Film Submission pages. It was also used to help understand browser error message codes. Claude was used to help troubleshoot during the process of deploying to Render, including understanding Render logs (discovered that there was some file naming issues and an incorrect path).

The Husky Logo was generated for Project 2 (re-used on the homepage and navbar) and was originally created with Adobe Generative AI.
